We are formed by little scraps of wisdom.There is no counting the lessons I've received from my father and he's never short of profundity or sweeping words of wisdom about the state of the world we live in when sometimes all you're trying to do is leave the house. My father's greatest lesson to me has been in fearlessness, it has been in teaching me to never be afraid of who I am. He taught me how all the reasons I think I can't fit into the world are actually all the reasons I can - then he taught me how overrated fitting in is.

31,15,"Thu Nov 24 01:05:05 2016",shaheenbhatt,API,"I once read an idea by an American essayist called Richard Mitchell which stayed with me; its now become how I try to approach the dips in my week or month.

Well, I spend a fair amount of time on social media during the course of my day and today I found myself looking for something to post because it's been a few days since I've posted anything. I couldn't find anything so I figured I'd just talk about this -how I'm doing, instead of what I'm doing. It's as simple as that, and we could all stand to do a little more of it."
